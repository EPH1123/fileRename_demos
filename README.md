# fileRename_demos
Example scripts to batch-rename files (various languages) 

Purpose: demonstrate how to rename files in bulk, using several languages.

Intended audience: people who often deal with repetitive/manual tasks, who may not be aware of automation possibilities, do not often write code, or may not yet be comfortable with code generation tools.

Planned languages to use for this demo:
* Matlab (Done)
 
* Python (to do)
 
* VBA (to do)
 
* Bash (to do)

* C (to do maybe?)
